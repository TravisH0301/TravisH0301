Welcome to my GitHub!<br>
I'm a data professional and I love applying technology to build innovative solutions and value.<br>
You can check out my [`data_science_projects`](https://github.com/TravisH0301/data_science_projects) folder to browse some of my projects completed in the past.<br>
I also keep some brief notes while learning in [`learning`](https://github.com/TravisH0301/learning) folder.<br>
Happy coding!
