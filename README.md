I'm a data professional with a background in data science and engineering.<br>
I enjoy learning and love to apply technology to create innovations and values.

My github contains some of footprints of my learning journey, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge in data engineering.<br>
You can check out [`learning`](https://github.com/TravisH0301/learning) and [`data_projects`](https://github.com/TravisH0301/data_science_projects) for the notes and projects I've made during learning.
