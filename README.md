I'm a data professional with a background in data science and engineering.<br>
I love applying technology to build innovative solutions and create values. 

My github contains some of footprints of my learning journey, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge in data engineering.<br>
You can check out [`learning`](https://github.com/TravisH0301/learning) and [`data_projects`](https://github.com/TravisH0301/data_science_projects) for the notes and projects I've made during learning.
